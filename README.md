# Tyler's Cafe

A simple React site that displays a menu for my home cafe.

Forked from [Autumn Bullard's](https://autumnchris.github.io/portfolio) amazing [coffee shop example](https://github.com/autumnchris/multipage-coffee-shop-site-reactjs)!

## Getting Started

This project doesn't have any build steps. It leverages ESM & HTM to render the React app on the fly.
